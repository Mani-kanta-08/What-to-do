# To-Do List App (Tkinter)

A simple **To-Do List** application built using **Python and Tkinter**. This app allows users to **add and remove tasks** with a simple graphical interface.

## Features
âœ… Add tasks to the list  
âœ… Remove selected tasks from the list  
âœ… Simple and clean GUI  
âœ… Lightweight and fast  

## Requirements
Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed on your system.

### Install Tkinter (if not pre-installed)
Tkinter is included in standard Python installations, but if it's missing, install it using:
```bash
pip install tk
```

## How to Run the App
1. Download or clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todo-list-tkinter.git
   cd todo-list-tkinter
   ```
2. Run the Python script:

   python todo_list.py
   ```

## Code Overview
The main functionalities include:
- `add_task()`: Adds a task to the list.
